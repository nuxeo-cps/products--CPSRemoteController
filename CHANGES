New features:

- Added event notification for document moving and multiple documents
  publishing.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed the getPublishedDocuments() availability statement.
- Synced the getLocalRoles() method with the latest version of the

- Made the methods getRoles(), getLocalRoles() and checkPermission() usable by
  any user with the View permission instead of the ChangePermissions permission.
  This is not a security risk and this is also more logical.
