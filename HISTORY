-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Modified createDocument and editOrCreateDocument so that they return the rpath
  of the document instead of its id.
- Added the deleteDocument method.
- Added the acceptDocument method.
- Made it possible to not publish directly documents but to submit them.
- Added a deleteDocumentLocks methods to delete all the locks owned by a user on
  the specified document.  Calling this method should be avoided but might be
  useful when a client application crashes and loses all the user locks.

  handle Unicode.
- Made the "replace" option of the publishDocument method work.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added unit tests.
- Renamed variables so that their names don't include the used data type.
